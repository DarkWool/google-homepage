The current project is for demonstrate that I'm currently learning HTML and also CSS by deconstructing the Google Homepage and try to replicate it in some sense, It's very important to note that this is an assignment for The Odin Project foundations course.

At the end of the project I would have some experience with:
	1. The Web Developer Tools to analyze the contents of another web page and understand them.
	2. Write HTML and CSS code by my own, trying to really understand what's happening.
	3. Get more familiarized with the git commands.
